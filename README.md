# Unit Commitment (Electrical Power Generation)

This repository contains an implementation of a Unit Commitment problem. Electric power companies around the world utilize mathematical optimization to manage the flow of energy across their electrical grids. This work harnesses the power of mathematical optimization in addressing a common energy industry problem: electrical power generation. 

The objective is to determine which generators should be turned on or off at each hour within the 24-hour period to meet anticipated demand to minimize total cost.

By determining the most efficient combination of generators to meet the anticipated power demand over a 24-hour period, mathematical optimization directly contributes to minimizing operational costs while ensuring reliable power supply. This practical application underscores the significance of mathematical optimization in making strategic, cost-effective decisions in real-world energy management.
