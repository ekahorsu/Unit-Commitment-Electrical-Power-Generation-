# Unit Commitment (Electrical Power Generation)

This repository contains an implementation of a Unit Commitment problem.

The objective is to determine which generators should be turned on or off at each hour within the 24-hour period to meet anticipated demand to minimize total cost.

By determining the most efficient combination of generators to meet the anticipated power demand over a 24-hour period, mathematical optimization directly contributes to minimizing operational costs while ensuring reliable power supply. This practical application underscores the significance of mathematical optimization in making strategic, cost-effective decisions in real-world energy management.

This model is example 15 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming by H. Paul Williams on pages 270 – 271 and 325 – 326.
